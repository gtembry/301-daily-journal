Today I learned about responsive web design based on what the reading assignment was. It was cool. But what got me today was the codewars assignment. I discovered REGEX or regular expressions. So that was fun. Tomorrow I will do some pair programming with Michael.

## Learning journal Code 301 - day 2

Today I immediately after class started the pair-programming assignment with my partner Mark. The TODO items were fairly difficult. There was some review for me in wrapping my head around constructor functions again. I found that jQuery makes life easier. Also, using Regex in the codewars challenge wasn't too difficult. adding 'i' after /g basically means to not care about specificity in lowercase or capitalization. yeah..

Today I spent a considerable amount of time doing codewars. It took about 2 hours to figure out the solution to be arr.reverse();. We experimented with a for loop, which also worked, but took more work. The pair-programming was quite difficult for bot my partner and I, but my partner was grasping it much more than me.

Today we had a fun codewars assignment. Simple validation of a username with REGEX. The solution /^[a-z-09]{4,16}$/g. inside the [] limits the username to alphanumerics and an underscore, and inside {} limits the username between 4 and 16 characters. the ^ starts whereas the $ ends. With Regex, I was able to complete this task. Thanks REGEX!

Today I learned how convert a name into initials using the .split method. I created two variables that takes the first letter of each name. One var targeting the first name and the other variable targeting the last name. They target the indices and return the string as the initials of the persons name. Hope this makes sense.

Today I learned what JSON and AJAX are and how to use them to load new data.

## Learning journal code 301 - day 7

Today I learned about NODE.JS. I learned how to initialize my project using NPM to create and populate a package.json file. "nodemon" is also cool.

# Learning journal code 301 - day 8

Today I learned about SQL. Structured Query Language. It has one singular purpose to interact with a database.

## Learning journal code 301 - day 9

Today we learned about SQL joins and Relations. We had about about 6 hours of lecture today. Yeah. If anything, backend doesn't know anything about the front-end unless communicated with AJAX.. I think I said that correctly, I'll ask Tomorrow.

# Learning journal code 301 - day 10

Today I learned more about functional programming. .map, .flatten, yeah. Also, SQL joins makes more sense. Just a bit.

## Learning journal code 301 - day 11

Today I learned about single page apps and client-side routing. We explored client-side route-based functionality. The purpose is to create a more efficient and modular single page web application. YES, to all of this.

# Learning journal code 301 - day 12

Today I learned about RESTful Api. REpresentational State Transfer. It symbolizes a way a in building a back and front-end for your application to be scalable to have URLs. It's mostly about isolating responsibilities from the front-end and backend to not have them overlap in any way.

## Learning journal code 301 - day 13

Today I learned about Heroku deployment. Git and Heroku work hand in hand. Heroku is responsible for creating the app and github stores the source code for said app.

# Learning journal code 301 - day 14

 Today I learned you can get a codepoint from any index in a string using String.prototype.charCodeAt.

## Learning journal code 301 - day 15

 Today I learned that one major benefit of client-side routing in terms of user-experience is that it avoid server requests. Therefore, it's faster.

# Learning journal code 301 - day 16

Today I learned that we could not capture a screenshot of point on a map using the google maps api, then exporting it to said captured image to a different page.
