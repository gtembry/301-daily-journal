# Learning journal Code 301

Today I learned about responsive web design based on what the reading assignment was. It was cool. But what got me today was the codewars assignment. I discovered REGEX or regular expressions. So that was fun. Tomorrow I will do some pair programming with Michael.

Today I immediately after class started the pair-programming assignment with my partner Mark. The TODO items were fairly difficult. There was some review for me in wrapping my head around constructor functions again. I found that jQuery makes life easier. Also, using Regex in the codewars challenge wasn't too difficult. adding 'i' after /g basically means to not care about specificity in lowercase or capitalization. yeah..

Today I spent a considerable amount of time doing codewars. It took about 2 hours to figure out the solution to be arr.reverse();. We experimented with a for loop, which also worked, but took more work. The pair-programming was quite difficult for bot my partner and I, but my partner was grasping it much more than me.
