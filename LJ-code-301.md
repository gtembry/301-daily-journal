# Learning journal Code 301

Today I learned about responsive web design based on what the reading assignment was. It was cool. But what got me today was the codewars assignment. I discovered REGEX or regular expressions. So that was fun. Tomorrow I will do some pair programming with Michael.

Today I immediately after class started the pair-programming assignment with my partner Mark. The TODO items were fairly difficult. There was some review for me in wrapping my head around constructor functions again. I found that jQuery makes life easier. Also, using Regex in the codewars challenge wasn't too difficult. adding 'i' after /g basically means to not care about specificity in lowercase or capitalization. yeah..

Today I spent a considerable amount of time doing codewars. It took about 2 hours to figure out the solution to be arr.reverse();. We experimented with a for loop, which also worked, but took more work. The pair-programming was quite difficult for bot my partner and I, but my partner was grasping it much more than me.

Today we had a fun codewars assignment. Simple validation of a username with REGEX. The solution /^[a-z-09]{4,16}$/g. inside the [] limits the username to alphanumerics and an underscore, and inside {} limits the username between 4 and 16 characters. the ^ starts whereas the $ ends. With Regex, I was able to complete this task. Thanks REGEX!

Today I learned how convert a name into initials using the .split method. I created two variables that takes the first letter of each name. One var targeting the first name and the other variable targeting the last name. They target the indices and return the string as the initials of the persons name. Hope this makes sense.

Today I learned about NODE.JS. I learned how to initialize my project using NPM to create and populate a package.json file. "nodemon" is also cool.
